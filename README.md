# Learning stuff

Collecting all my projects that I build to learn things in one place so that I don't create a new repository every time and also serves a nice organization strategy.

99% of things in here are written without AI-assistance in the Cursor, Claude Code, Opencode, etc. sense. I'll mostly be using it to guide me through some of these projects like a tutor.
